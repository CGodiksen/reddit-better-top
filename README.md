# Reddit Better Top
Browser extension offering more time options for the "Top" feature on Reddit. 

Currently Reddit only allows you to see the top posts within today, the last week, the last month, the last year and all time. This browser extension adds more time options, making it possible to also see top posts within the last three days, two weeks and six months.

The extension also includes a browser action in the toolbar that allows for a completely custom top search.
